# Operating system
## Chapter 1 
### Introduction
- A operating system is software that manages a computer's hardware/
- It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.
- It is important first to understand the organization and architecture of computer hardware.
- This inculuds 
- 1. the CPU
- 2. memory
- 3. I/O divices
- 4. storage.
- A fundamental responsibility of an operatong system is to allocate these resources to programs.
- we cover several topics to help set the stage for reminder of the text:
  - 1. data structures used in operating systems
  - 2. computing environments
  - 3. open-source 
  - 4. free operating systems. 
  ### Operating systems role in the overall computer system
  - A computer system can be divided roughly into four components:
    - 1. hardware :
       - the central processing unit (CPU), 
       - the memory
       - and the input/output(I/O) devices
       - provides the basic computing resources for the system. 
    - 2. the operating system :
       -  controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.
    - 3. the application programs :
       - such as word processors, spreadsheets, complier, and web browsers
       - defined the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems. 
       - it's provides an enviroment within other programs can do useful work.
    - 4. a user
