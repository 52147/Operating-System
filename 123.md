# Operating system
## Chapter 1 
### Introduction
- A operating system is software that manages a computer's hardware/
- It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.
- It is important first to understand the organization and architecture of computer hardware.
- This inculuds 
- 1. the CPU
- 2. memory
- 3. I/O divices
- 4. storage.
- A fundamental responsibility of an operatong system is to allocate these resources to programs.
- we cover several topics to help set the stage for reminder of the text:
  - 1. data structures used in operating systems
  - 2. computing environments
  - 3. open-source 
  - 4. free operating systems. 
  ### Operating systems role in the overall computer system
  - A computer system can be divided roughly into four components:
    - 1. hardware :
       - the central processing unit (CPU), 
       - the memory
       - and the input/output(I/O) devices
       - provides the basic computing resources for the system. 
    - 2. the operating system :
       -  controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.
    - 3. the application programs :
       - such as word processors, spreadsheets, complier, and web browsers
       - defined the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems. 
       - it's provides an enviroment within other programs can do useful work.
    - 4. a user
    
- We next explore operating systems from 2 viewpoints:
-  that of the user and that of the system.
#### User view
- The user's view of the computer varies according to the interface being used.
- Many computer users sit with a laptop or in front of a PC consisting of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
- Such a system is designed for user to monopolize its resources.
- The goal is to maximize the work that the user is performing.
- In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for easy of use, with some attention  paid to performance and security 
- and none paid to resource utilization -- how various hardware and software resources are shared.

#### moblie computer
- The user interfaces for mobile computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical keyboard and mouse.
- Many mobile devices also allow users to interact through a voice recognition interface, such as Apple's Siri.

#### Computers with no user view
- for example, embedded computers in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads
- and may turn indicator lights on or off to show status,
- but they and they operating systems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.

#### System view
- From the computer's point of view,
- the operating system is the progtam ,ost intimately invilved with the hardware.
- we can view an operating system as a resource allocator
- A computer ststem has many resources that may be required to solve a problem:
 - 1. CPU time
 - 2. memory space
 - 3. storage space
 - 4. I/O devices, and so on.

#### operating system is a resource allocator
- The operating system acts as the manager of these resources.
- Facing numerous and possibly conflicying requests for resources,
- the operating system must decide how to allcoate then to specific programs and users 
- so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.

#### operating system is a control program
 - A slightly different view of an operating system emphasized the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs.
 - A operating system is a control program.
 - A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.
 - It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.
    
#### when operating system were born
- In 1960s, Moore's Law predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every 18 months, and the prediction has held true.
- Computer gained in functionality and shrank in size, 
- leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and variety of operating systems.
