## Chapter 1 
### Introduction
- A operating system is software that manages a computer's hardware/
- It also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between the computer user and the computer hardware.
- It is important first to understand the organization and architecture of computer hardware.
- This inculuds 
- 1. the CPU
- 2. memory
- 3. I/O divices
- 4. storage.
- A fundamental responsibility of an operatong system is to allocate these resources to programs.
- we cover several topics to help set the stage for reminder of the text:
  - 1. data structures used in operating systems
  - 2. computing environments
  - 3. open-source 
  - 4. free operating systems. 
   
### Operating systems role in the overall computer system
  - A computer system can be divided roughly into four components:
    - 1. hardware :
       - the central processing unit (CPU), 
       - the memory
       - and the input/output(I/O) devices
       - provides the basic computing resources for the system. 
    - 2. the operating system :
       -  controls the hardware and coordinates its use among the various application programs for the various users.
    - 3. the application programs :
       - such as word processors, spreadsheets, complier, and web browsers
       - defined the ways in which these resources are used to solve user's computing problems. 
       - it's provides an enviroment within other programs can do useful work.
    - 4. a user
    
- We next explore operating systems from 2 viewpoints:
-  that of the user and that of the system.
#### User view
- The user's view of the computer varies according to the interface being used.
- Many computer users sit with a laptop or in front of a PC consisting of a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
- Such a system is designed for user to monopolize its resources.
- The goal is to maximize the work that the user is performing.
- In this case, the operating system is designed mostly for easy of use, with some attention  paid to performance and security 
- and none paid to resource utilization -- how various hardware and software resources are shared.

#### moblie computer
- The user interfaces for mobile computers generally features a touch screen, where the user interacts with the system by pressing and swiping fingers across the screen rather than using a physical keyboard and mouse.
- Many mobile devices also allow users to interact through a voice recognition interface, such as Apple's Siri.

#### Computers with no user view
- for example, embedded computers in home devices and automobiles may have numeric keypads
- and may turn indicator lights on or off to show status,
- but they and they operating systems and applications are designed primarily to run without user intervention.

#### System view
- From the computer's point of view,
- the operating system is the progtam ,ost intimately invilved with the hardware.
- we can view an operating system as a resource allocator
- A computer ststem has many resources that may be required to solve a problem:
 - 1. CPU time
 - 2. memory space
 - 3. storage space
 - 4. I/O devices, and so on.

#### operating system is a resource allocator
- The operating system acts as the manager of these resources.
- Facing numerous and possibly conflicying requests for resources,
- the operating system must decide how to allcoate then to specific programs and users 
- so that it can operate the computer system efficiently and fairly.

#### operating system is a control program
 - A slightly different view of an operating system emphasized the need to control the various I/O devices and user programs.
 - A operating system is a control program.
 - A control program manages the execution of user programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.
 - It is especially concerned with the operation and control of I/O devices.
    
#### 1980 operating system were born : Moore's Law
- In 1960s, Moore's Law predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every 18 months, and the prediction has held true.
- Computer gained in functionality and shrank in size, 
- leading to a vast number of uses and a vast number and variety of operating systems.

#### system kernal
- We have no universally accepted definition of what is part of the operating system.
- A more common definition , and the one that we usually follow, is the ath operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer
- -- usually called the kernel.
- Along with the kernal, there are 2 other types of programs:
  - 1. system programs:
    - which are associtaed with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernal,
  - 2. application programs:
    - which include all programs not associated with the operation of the system

#### Mobile operating systems : middleware
- mobile operating systems often include not only a core kernal but also middleware
- -- a set of software framwork that provide additional services to application developers.
  - For example:
    - each of the two most prominent mobile operating systems
    - -- Apple's iOs and Google's Android
    - -- features a core kernal along with middleware that supports databases, multimediam and graphics.



- In summary, the operating system includes 
  - 1. the always running kernal,
  - 2. middleware framworks :
    - that ease application development and provide features 
  - 3. system programs :
    - that aid in managing the system while it is running. 

### 1.2 Computer-System Organization

#### Device controller
- A modern gernal-purpose computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provides access between components and shared memory. 
- Each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device 
- (for example, a disk drive,audio device, or graphics display). 
- Depending on the controller, more than one device may be attached. 
  - For instance, one system USB port can connect to a USB hub, to which several devices can connect. 

- A device controller maintains some local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers. 
- The device controller is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices that it controls and its local buffer storage.
- Typically, operating systems have a device driver for each device controller. This device driver understands the device controller and provides the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device. 
- The CPU and the device controllers can execute in parallel, competing for memory cycles. To
ensure orderly access to the shared memory, a memory controller synchronizes access to the memory.
- In the following subsections, we describe some basics of how such a system operates, focusing on three key aspects of the system. We start with interrupts,
-  which alert the CPU to events that require attention. We then discuss storage structure and I/O structure.

#### 1.2.1 Interrupts
- Consider a typical computer operation: a program performing I/O. 

- To start an I/O operation, the device driver loads the appropriate registers in the device controller. 
- The device controller, in turn, examines the contents of these registers to determine what action to take
- (such as “read a character from the keyboard”).

- The controller starts the transfer of data from the device to its local buffer. 
- Once the transfer of data is complete, the device controller informs the device driver that it has finished its operation.
- The device driver then gives control to other parts of the operating system, possibly returning the data or a pointer to the data if the operation was a read. 
  - For other operations, the device driver returns status information such as “write completed successfully” or “device busy”.
  
- But how does the controller inform the device driver that it has finished its operation? This is accomplished via an interrupt.
